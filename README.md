I decided that I would like to have a website that could be a sort of digital resume where I could showcase what I have learned relating to computer science and programming,
as well as different projects I have worked on.

This website was my first venture into the world of web development, and as such it was a great learning experience. I developed this website from scratch without the help of any 
site creators such as Wix or Weebly, using only code references, tack overflow articles, etc.
